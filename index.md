## Welcome to The Unvarnished Geek!

Noise. So much noise. 

And so much waste.

Creating and interacting with digital content is inevitable for everyone these days, but, as we all know, the signal-to-noise ratio of the internet has made separating the valuable content from the noise and clutter of advertising, bots, misinformation, and just plain nonsense almost impossible. The internet generates more waste than product anymore, both in digital terms and in real ones (in the form of very destructive e-waste in the very non-digital world).

This will be a blog for those of us who want to use digital tools to create and communicate meaninful things *without* adding to the noise and clutter, and keeping the process elegant and streamlined from our initial thoughts to worldwide deployment.

## Welcome to The Unvarnished Geek!


![Sometimes simpler is better](/assets/terminal.png)

This will be a blog for those of us who want to use digital tools to create and communicate meaningful things *without* the noise and clutter of most modern computing, and to keep the process elegant and streamlined from our initial thoughts to worldwide deployment.

### Some topics I'll cover:

- Plain-text writing (fast, focused, sustainable)
- Plain-text computing tools (working with elegance)
- Vintage computing for real work (I can write this blog on my Commodore 128D!)
- Resources for more elegant computing
